* Your card has expired/been cancelled.
* The credit limit on your card has been reached.
* Your card details have changed but your agreement has not been updated

Visit our Shopper Help page at http://www.worldpay.com/shopper if:

* You have a query regarding the billing of your agreement
* You want to login to the Shopper Management System to check your FuturePay agreement details, cancel the agreement, or make changes to your card, contact or username/password details.

If you have forgotten your username and password, check the confirmation email we sent to you when this agreement was set up. Alternatively, use the "Forgotten your password?" link on the Shopper Help page to request a replacement.
